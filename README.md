# Bayesian-Model-Evaluation-for-Cosmology



## Data

This project uses the **DES-SN5YR Type Ia Supernova dataset** provided by the Dark Energy Survey Collaboration. 
(https://github.com/des-science/DES-SN5YR/)

⚠️ I do not own or produce this dataset. If you use these data in your own work, please cite the DES publication above.  

The repository contains only **derived covariance matrices and posterior samples** needed for the Bayesian model comparison.  
To reproduce results from scratch, please obtain the original DES-SN5YR data from the official sources.
